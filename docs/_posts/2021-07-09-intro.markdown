Starting this weekend, I've decided to dedicate some time to play with stuff that I don't get to during the weekdays.

I've been meaning to learn [Kotlin][kotlin] for a looong time now and although I made a few half starts, I just abandoned due to various reasons. But this I intend to go through with it. I've also wanted to learn basics of [gRPC][grpc] for a while now. So what I've decided to do is to write a simple gRPC server in Kotlin and make a call to the gRPC server from a simple Kotlin gRPC client.

And, to kick things off, I'm having to learn some `Markdown`, [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] and how this works with github-pages!

I'll post the end result by the end of the weekend. 

[kotlin]:     https://kotlinlang.org
[grpc]:       https://grpc.io/
[jekyll-gh]:  https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
