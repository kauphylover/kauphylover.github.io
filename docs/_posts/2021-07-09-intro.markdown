Starting this weekend, I've decided to dedicate some time to play with stuff that I don't get to during weekdays.

I've been meaning to learn [Kotlin][kotlin] for a very long time now and although I made a few half-starts, I never made any real progress. But this time I intend to go through with it. I've also wanted to learn basics of [gRPC][grpc] for a while now. So what I've decided to do is to write a simple gRPC server in Kotlin and make a call to the gRPC server from a simple Kotlin gRPC client.

And, to kick things off, I'm having to learn some `Markdown`, [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] and how this works with github-pages!

I'll post the end result by the end of the weekend. 

EDIT (6th Sept 2021): So, after being away from work for about a couple of months, I finally found some time to wrap this up. The end-result is [here][grpc-kotlin-helloworld].
