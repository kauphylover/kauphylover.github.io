I'm Abhirama Mallela and currently work in the cloud-native technology space.
I'm passionate about all things tech. I love playing with new, shiny stuff and 
this `tlog` (don't worry, you didn't not know it. I just invented it - it's a tech log) is an attempt at creating a record of things I touch and play with and 
my impressions of them. It's something I should've started a few years earlier
but better late than never.
